# Flipper-Zero-Animations
My custom made Flipper Zero Animation.

In short:  
PNGs folder - contains animation frames in .PNG format to view them (animated previews below)

BMs folder - contains above animations in .BM format already ready :) to be implanted into your Flipper

To use the animation in your Flipper you need to edit a "manifest.txt" file and add there lines:

Name: happy            ----> animation name here for example of the "happy" animation 

Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 14       ----> 14 is max for ClaraCrazy Xtreme Firmware, 8 is max (as I remember) for Official and Unleashed Firmwares

Min level: 1
Max level: 30          ----> 30 is max for ClaraCrazy Xtreme Firmware, 3 is max (as I remember) for Official and Unleashed Firmwares

Weight: 3
